# 01 Goal: 

    The goal of this project is to convert our portfolio from Assignment 16 into a REACT environment. Here is a link to the Github folder https://emjayosee.github.io/20_React_Portfolio/
    and a link to the deployed website https://employee-directory-michael.herokuapp.com/.

# 02 Approach:

    In approaching the project, I realized that I have sufficient content, but am building my portfolio around my professional art work, websites and professional writing.  However, with this in mind, I still am working towards the requirements of the assignment, including:

        1. An updated portfolio featuring 6 total projects [ ]

        2. Built using using React [ ]

        3. A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages [ ]

        4. A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page [ ]

        5. Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router [ ]

        6. A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

        7. Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring those same projects

        8. Deploy this site to Heroku [ ]


    Your updated site should still have all of the content it previously had:

        9. Your name [ ]

        10. Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number [ ]

        11. A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects [ ]

        12. A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

                - Project title [ ]
                - Link to the deployed version [ ]
                - Link to the GitHub repository [ ]
                - GIF or screenshot of the deployed application [ ]


# 03 Testing and Quality Control:

    1. Test each of the criteria to confirm functionality.

    2. Format JSX Code to make it easier to follow when viewed at source.

    3. Load the files and tested the page functionality at GITHUB.

    4. Run NPM Build to ensure proper compling.
